# CarApp UI/UX & Error Handling TODO

## 1. Visual Hierarchy & Typography
- [ ] Audit all screens for consistent use of font family [use a combination of Titillium Web and Inter].
- [ ] Standardize font sizes and weights for headings, subheadings, and body text.
- [ ] Make section titles (e.g., "Owner Information", "Pricing & Specifications", chat headers) bolder and larger for clear separation.
- [ ] Ensure button text is bold and easily readable.
- [ ] Use a clear visual hierarchy for cards, lists, and forms (spacing, font size, !important color contrast).
- [ ] Enforce use of colorTheme file for all text and background colors (no hardcoded values).
- [ ] Add global styles or theme overrides to ensure font and color consistency.

## 2. Error Handling & User Notification
- [ ] Implement global error boundary to catch and display errors (show a fallback UI or error screen if the app crashes).
- [ ] Add Android Toast (or similar notification) for transient errors (e.g., no internet connection, failed API calls).
- [ ] Show inline error messages for form validation errors (e.g., invalid input, required fields).
- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages for network/API errors (e.g., "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection.").
- [ ] Add loading and error states to all async actions (e.g., car list fetch, chat send, image upload).
- [ ] Add a global network status listener to notify users of connectivity changes.

## 3. Empty & Loading States
- [ ] Add visually appealing empty states for lists (e.g., "No cars found", "No chats yet") with icons or illustrations.

- [ ] Use skeleton loaders or spinners for loading states.

## 4. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure all touch targets are at least 44x44px.
- [ ] Add accessibility labels to all actionable elements (buttons, inputs, icons).
- [ ] Test and adjust layouts for different device sizes.

## 5. Consistency & Polish
- [ ] Standardize spacing (padding/margin) between elements across all screens.
- [ ] Use consistent card and button styles (rounded corners, shadows, color usage).
- [ ] Ensure all images have consistent aspect ratios and rounded corners.

## 6. Miscellaneous
- [ ] Review and update color usage for contrast and brand consistency.
- [ ] Add status badges (e.g., "Approved", "Pending") with color coding where relevant.
- [ ] Test all flows for error handling and user feedback.

**Prioritize the most visible and impactful changes first (typography, error notifications, loading/empty states).**

Add more items as needed during implementation.
